Now that I'm finished with the [Cloud Genius bootcamp][] I'm furiously hunting for job prospects, going to various meetups, and schmoozing with movers and shakers.  And I'm heading to [KubeCon 2017][] in Austin, TX this here December.  All the more important to square away that basic necessity of networking:  **business cards**.

I am going in with two goals in mind:

 * Spend little time & money
 * Make a professional card that's not too overblown or contrived

I started with a basic google search for "business cards".

 * [Vistaprint][]:  well known but reportedly low quality.  From a perusal of their site it's clear business cards are just one of their many printed products.  $20 for 1000 basic cards.
 * [Zazzle][]:  wow.  Demo cards were very colorful and vibrant.  I'm getting a strong 'fancy' reading.  $22 for 100 of their minimalist cards.
 * [Gotprint][]:  simple to somewhat stylish options at deal prices.  $20 for 1000 of their most basic card.
 * [Moo][]:  their claim to fame is Printfinity which allows you to upload a set of images to make "unique" business cards.  That's neat, and I'm impressed that they have UV embossed ink and NFC business cards, but the most interesting offering is that they showcase simple, bold designs.  But $20 for 50 cards?  Ouch.  Pricey.

So here's what I'm looking at putting on my card:

Simple.  Black & white, no image or graphic.

Now I'm not completely convinced this is going to be the card I use for the next year as I hope to channel my expertise and refine my value proposition.  That said, I don't need a lot of cards.  If I give away 100 cards between now and January, I'd be happy, as I don't espouse tossing them out without first establishing some connection.

I'm going to sleep on it one more night.  I hope to get some feedback on the design by then.
