I bought a [Zolt][] [laptop charger][] the other day and already am in love with it.  What's funny is how I found out about it.  While researching cool companies to work for, I found this engineering firm: [Synapse][].  They've helped design things like Valve's [steam controller][] and Synesso's [Hydra][] espresso machine.  Wicked cool company.

For the record, this review is for model **ZM070LTPX01**.

### **Lightness**

It's *much* lighter than the typical transformer/rectifier brick that you get with a laptop.  What's more impressive is that it doesn't blast heat and burn your hand like you might expect.

### **Modularity**

The **Zolt** comes with an array of adaptor tips that you can switch out to fit with just about any modern laptop.

### **Power**

It's rated to charge a 65W laptop, a tablet and a phone at the same time.

### **Details**

The **Zolt** comes in very spiffy packaging.  These days it's hard to throw out the cool boxes your tech comes in!

Inside you will find the charger unit, a 6' cord, 8 adaptor tips, and a svelte drawstring pouch.

Here's a closeup shot of the adaptors with the handy compatibility table.

See the 3 prongs inside the recess of the adaptor?  (There's also an alignment flat.)

They plug right into the 3 sockets in the power cord!  The flat makes sure you get the alignment right.  Nobody wants bent power pins!

Solid manufacturing tolerances for a snug fit.  The *z11* is on display here to fit my Lenovo Thinkpad T430s.

Here's a look at the charging unit with the dust applique still in place.  (Never mind the dustyness and fingerprints, I had excitedly raced to take this off only to later realize I should put it back on for documentation purposes.)

Upon close inspection, a small slot can be observed left of the usb port labeled for the laptop.

A tab on the laptop power cable interfaces with this slot to idiot-proof the connection.  I expect/assume the usb ports are rated for different power output.

And here's my Thinkpad glowing happily with satisfactory power input.

The **Zolt** even lights up to let you know it's working.

_Engineering Tradeoff Warning:_  The **Zolt**'s "tower" architecture is great because it doesn't hog outlet space, however it is precariously cantilevered when plugged into a wall outlet.  Here's hoping you aren't using a loosey-goosey cafe socket!  This build really shines when plugged into a power strip on the floor, standing proud.

And lastly, the nice microfiber drawstring pouch.

### **Wrap-up**

I've been using my **Zolt** for a couple months now and I absolutely stoked with how lightweight and portable it is.  I also feel pretty cool (smug, perhaps?) when pulling it out in front of people.

It's still early but I've encountered no problems with it yet.  I got mine for $25 from NewEgg, marked down from $75.  I'm hoping that's not a harbinger of quality or reliability.

There are similar products out there on the market, such as the [Finsix Dart][].  It seems to be a tad slimmer, a bit pricier (+$10 at this time), and has an inline usb port @ 2.1A for another peripheral.  Interesting to note that the Dart is also marked down quite a bit from MSRP...
