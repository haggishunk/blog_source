I've recently been considering a [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/) along with a password manager for all my security needs.  Two factor authentication, though a bit more burdensome for the typical user in the workplace, is endeared to those business owners for it's near invulnerability short of a social engineering attack whereby someone pwns your password *AND* your keyfob.  Oh, and you should use it on a personal level anytime $$$ or credit is involved.

Recently at Def Con 2017, some hackers (errr, security researchers) demonstrated a [proof of concept breaking Yubico's 2FA](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8xazek/hackers-show-proof-of-concepts-to-beat-hardware-based-2fa).  "Oh no," you say?  Well one of the researchers, Joe Fitzpatrick, assuaged our fears about this "supply chain attack" saying, "keep using your YubiKeys, keep using your tokens."  Good, because I just ordered one!

[Stay tuned for how I fare with it]
