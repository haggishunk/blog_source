Octopress is a wonderfully easy way to run yourself a blog.  I picked it up a couple days back and have already popped out my first ever posts with minimal effort.  But alternatives and options abound, and since Ruby isn't what I know, I decided to look into something more Pythonic.

So this weekend I'll give these meager posts a bit of [awk & sed work](http://blog.dornea.nu/2014/06/18/migrate-this-blog-from-octopress-to-pelican/), compliments of [Victor's](https://github.com/dorneanu) craftiness, and migrate over to Pelican.
