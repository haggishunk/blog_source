The very cool project [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/) that I found out about at the recent [PUG](http://puggroup.com) (Public-Cloud User Group) meetup turned me on to the concept of [Chaos Testing](https://codefresh.io/blog/chaos_testing_docker/).  Sounds a lot like what my teacher does in his demos for the [CloudGenius](https://be.a.cloudgeni.us) bootcamp.
