No more will Qumulo clients be limited to running their file storage system in a single data center.  [QF2 File Fabric](https://qumulo.com/decide/options/) allows for a distributed system across private and public clouds.

To my novice eye, object storage and file storage seem to have the same characteristics, but maybe that's because of the APIs.  Thankfully there's quite a bit of [info](http://searchcloudstorage.techtarget.com/feature/How-an-object-store-differs-from-file-and-block-storage) out there on this very subject.
